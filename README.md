## Usage
1. Either download a release [here](https://github.com/festivize/Blender-miHoYo-Shaders/releases), or download from the [source](https://github.com/festivize/Blender-miHoYo-Shaders/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) for the latest commit.
2. In a new project with your desired character mesh, append whatever materials the .blend file you downloaded will contain.
3. Replace the original materials of the mesh with the materials from the .blend file you just appended.
4. Import the textures into their corresponding image nodes/texture slots.
5. Constrain the empty object named *Head Origin* to the head bone of your character with a **Child Of** constraint.
7. This [video](https://youtu.be/97G7LqFoTdY) made by [No_Tables](https://twitter.com/No_Tables) showcases the actual shader without any post-processing, and provides an overview as well.

9. Check out this [Blender add-on](https://github.com/michael-gh1/Addons-And-Tools-For-Blender-miHoYo-Shaders) by Mken for automating the set-up for the shader.

## Rules
- The [GPL-3.0 License](https://github.com/festivize/Blender-miHoYo-Shaders/blob/main/LICENSE) applies.
- If you use this shader as is in renders, animations or any form of medium that does not directly modify the shader, I'd appreciate being credited - **you don't have to do it though.**
- If you use this shader as the main reference for your own shader, please give credit where it's due.
- In compliance with the license, you are free to redistribute the files as long as you attach a link to the source repository.

For that, I'd like to give back to the community with what I've learned. With that said, I hope you learn a thing or two. Enjoy!

## Disclaimer
These shaders aren't meant to be 100% accurate. What I only aim for is to replicate the in-game looks to the best of my ability.

While the shaders are developed primarily for datamined assets, this repository does not endorse datamining in any way whatsoever and will never directly provide the assets nor tools in extracting from game files.

## Since you've read this far...
Using this shader is completely **free** if it's not already evident from the license BUT - if and only if you have something to spare and would like to support me, then you can do so on my Ko-fi [here](https://ko-fi.com/festivity). I appreciate every tip and each one motivates me to keep on improving the shader.
